title: 'The Design of Interactive Computational Media'
offerings: 
- Winter 2022, Winter 2023
summary: |
    User-centered design results in robust solutions that successfully address real human problems. In this course, students will learn about methods and principles of user-centered design to explore a problem space and the people within that space, identifying usersâ€™ needs, system constraints and requirements, and ultimately designing solutions that incorporate all those components. Designs will be iterated from initial concepts to really valuable solutions by gathering feedback and usability testing prototypes with users throughout the course. The course project will culminate with the development of a robust design that addresses the identified problem. Final project presentations will take place at the end of the course.

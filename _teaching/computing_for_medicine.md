summary: |
    This is a year-long course offered to first-year medical students to provide them with the foundational skills they need to use computer programming in their future practices. Covering the Python programming language, students spend the first semester learning basic concepts like variables, program control flow, and data structures. During the second semester, students integrate these concepts into larger real-world programs related to medicine. The course culminates in a guided exercise involving the use of machine learning to predict the onset of a medical condition from vital sign data.

summary: |
    This is a year-long course offered to first-year medical students to provide them with the skills they need to use computer science in their future practices. The program originally covered basic concepts of computer programming in Python, covering topics like variables, program control flow, and data structures. However, the most recent iteration of the program was revamped to accommodate the increasing desire for topics in data science and machine learning. The first half of the program covers various ways of loading and manipulating tabular, time-series, and image data. In doing so, students learn basic concepts in statistics, digital signal processing, and even image processing. The second half of the program covers the basics of machine learning, covering topics like regression vs. classification, feature selection, and model interpretability.

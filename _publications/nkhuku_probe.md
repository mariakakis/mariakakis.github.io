abstract: |
    Poultry farming is a significant income-generating activity in subSaharan African (SSA) households. Poultry farmers frequently have to overcome extreme environmental conditions to maintain their chickens’ wellbeing. Prior research has proposed automating poultry farming activities to control environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity). However, these interventions have never been implemented, in this context, to understand how they would work and participants’ perceptions. Further, chicken coops in SSA have different configurations that would make technology automation difficult. To explore how technology can be used to address this problem, we worked with local collaborators to design and deploy “NkhukuProbe”—a low-cost sensor-based technology that poultry farmers can interact with via USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) to monitor and adjust chicken coop conditions. First, we conducted a review of related work on poultry farming in SSA and a pilot study with poultry farming experts. Findings from this work guided the design of NkhukuProbe. Then, we deployed NkhukuProbe in 15 Malawian households for one month. The goals of our deployment were to understand participants’ experiences using NkhukuProbe and to learn about other ways of using sensors in this context. To achieve these goals, we used interview, diary, observation and data logging to collect data throughout the deployment. Our findings suggest that a technology probe’s approach unveiled different opportunities for using sensors to support poultry farming in SSA. Further, NkhukuProbe motivated participants to think of other ways of using sensors. We present design implications based on these findings and offer new perspectives on the role of technology in supporting poultry farming activities.

abstract: |
  Diagnostic tests for influenza in Australia are currently only authorised for use in clinical settings. At-home diagnostic testing for influenza could reduce the need for patient contact with healthcare services, which potentially could contribute to symptomatic improvement and reduced spread of influenza. We aim to determine the accuracy of an app-guided nasal self-swab combined with a lateral flow immunoassay for influenza conducted by individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI).

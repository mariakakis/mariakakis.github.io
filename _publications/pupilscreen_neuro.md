abstract: |
    Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of mortality in people under age 45 and accounts for 2.5 million ED visits and $75 billion in healthcare costs each year in the United States. The key to ensuring the best possible clinical outcome for TBI patients is to facilitate their care at a designated trauma center. Unfortunately, up to 60% of severe TBI patients are undertriaged and admitted to non-trauma hospitals, a systemic problem which the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma has demonstrated results in an excess mortality of 25%. Evaluation of the pupillary light reflex (PLR) is a crucial factor in triaging TBI patients, but penlight-based manual pupillometry is known to be inaccurate and digital infrared pupillometry impractical for field use. PupilScreen, a pupillometry technology developed for smartphones, integrates the convenience of manual pupillometry with the accuracy of a digital infrared pupillometer and may represent a practical way to improve the triage of severe TBI patients.
